# Fullscreen-Safe Modal Implementation

## Problem
The student portal was using native browser `alert()` and `confirm()` dialogs during the assessment, which caused the browser to exit fullscreen mode. This created a security vulnerability as students could then access other applications or browser features during the test.

## Solution
Replaced all native browser dialogs with custom modal components that work seamlessly within fullscreen mode.

## Files Modified

### 1. **New Modal System Components**

#### `/src/components/context/ModalContext.tsx`
- Created a React Context for managing modals throughout the application
- Provides functions for showing different types of modals (success, error, warning, confirm)
- Manages modal state and provides easy-to-use hooks

#### `/src/components/Elements/CustomModal.tsx`
- Custom modal component that renders within the React DOM
- Supports different modal types (success, error, warning, confirm)
- High z-index (999999) to ensure visibility in fullscreen mode
- Backdrop blur and proper styling for better UX

### 2. **Application Integration**

#### `/src/pages/_app.tsx`
- Added `ModalProvider` to wrap the entire application
- Imported and rendered `CustomModal` component globally
- Ensures modals are available throughout the app

### 3. **Assessment Hook Updates**

#### `/src/components/Hooks/useAssessment.tsx`
- Replaced `alert()` calls with custom modal functions
- Updated submission success/error handling
- Added proper modal callbacks for page refreshes

### 4. **Assessment Page Updates**

#### `/src/pages/assessment/[slug].tsx`
- Replaced `confirm()` dialog for test submission with custom confirmation modal
- Updated malpractice handling to use warning modals instead of alerts
- Maintained all existing functionality while keeping fullscreen mode intact

### 5. **Styling Updates**

#### `/src/styles/globals.css`
- Added CSS rules to ensure modals work properly in fullscreen mode
- High z-index values for modal overlay and content
- Special rules for `body.test-active` state

## Features Implemented

### Modal Types
1. **Success Modal**: Green theme, single OK button
2. **Error Modal**: Red theme, single OK button  
3. **Warning Modal**: Yellow theme, single OK button
4. **Confirm Modal**: Blue theme, Cancel and Confirm buttons

### Fullscreen Compatibility
- All modals use extremely high z-index (999999) to appear above fullscreen content
- Backdrop blur effect works within fullscreen
- No DOM manipulation that could exit fullscreen mode
- Modals are rendered within the React component tree

### User Experience Improvements
- Consistent styling across all modal types
- Proper keyboard navigation support
- Click-outside-to-close for non-critical modals
- Prevent accidental dismissal of confirmation dialogs
- Better visual hierarchy with icons and color coding

## Security Benefits

1. **Fullscreen Integrity**: Students can no longer exit fullscreen mode accidentally through modal interactions
2. **Consistent Monitoring**: The fullscreen monitoring system remains active during all user interactions
3. **Better Control**: Custom modals provide more control over user interactions during tests
4. **Improved UX**: Students get better feedback without security compromises

## Implementation Details

### Modal Context Usage
```typescript
const { showConfirmModal, showSuccessModal, showErrorModal, showWarningModal } = useModal();

// Example usage
showConfirmModal(
  "Submit Test",
  "Are you sure you want to submit the test?",
  () => handleSubmit(),
  () => console.log('Cancelled'),
  "Submit",
  "Cancel"
);
```

### Z-Index Strategy
- Custom modals: 999999
- Fullscreen warning modals (existing): 99999
- Regular page content: Default values

This ensures custom modals appear above everything while maintaining the existing fullscreen security system.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Fullscreen Test**: Verify that modals appear correctly in fullscreen mode
2. **Modal Functionality**: Test all modal types (success, error, warning, confirm)
3. **Submission Flow**: Ensure test submission works without exiting fullscreen
4. **Security Monitoring**: Confirm that security warnings still function properly
5. **Browser Compatibility**: Test across different browsers and devices

## Backward Compatibility

- All existing functionality preserved
- No changes to the fullscreen monitoring system
- Existing security measures remain intact
- Same user flows with improved modal experience

## Future Enhancements

1. **Animation Support**: Add smooth transitions for modal appearance/disappearance
2. **Accessibility**: Enhance keyboard navigation and screen reader support
3. **Mobile Optimization**: Better touch interaction for mobile devices
4. **Custom Themes**: Allow different themes based on assessment type
5. **Modal Stacking**: Better handling of multiple simultaneous modals
